# **Classical ML**

Core machine learning algorithms implemented from first principles with detailed mathematical intuition. The objective is to deeply understand how classical ML models work — not just use high-level libraries.

## **Included**

- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Multiclass Logistic Regression  

## **Upcoming**

- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Decision Trees  
- Naive Bayes
