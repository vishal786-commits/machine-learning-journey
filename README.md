# Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on exploration of machine learning fundamentals.

Currently, I am focusing on implementing core algorithms and understanding their mathematical foundations through experiments and visualizations.

## Current Focus

### 📘 Classical Machine Learning
- Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
- Logistic Regression (Multi-Class - One-vs-Rest)
- Dataset visualization and decision boundary analysis
- Model evaluation and interpretation

Each notebook emphasizes:
- Concept clarity
- Implementation details
- Experimental insights

---

## Next Steps

Over the coming weeks, I plan to expand into:
- Additional classical ML algorithms
- Model comparison experiments
- Small end-to-end ML projects
- AI application systems

This repository will evolve as I progress from algorithm fundamentals to building production-oriented AI systems.
